# Fast Calories

Fast Calories is a lightweight web application that I made to help quickly find restaurants nearby based on the user's zipcode and generate a list of items which allow the user to remain under their caloric intake goals.

To install dependencies: run `npm install`  
To start application: run `npm start`

Technologies Used:
- React
