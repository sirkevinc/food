      <h1>Welcome to Fast Calories!</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        In a perfect world, humans would be able to eat anything that they want without 
        worrying about gaining or losing weight. Unfortunately, that is not the case. And 
        we must take calories into consideration. 
      <br />
      <br />
        Now, there's many factors for can affect a person's weight, but keeping track of calories
        is a great place to start!
      <br />
      <br />
        Try setting a daily goal for caloric intake and try to meet that goal.
      <br />
      <br />
        While it'd be great if we could all prepare clean and proper meals, our lives can be busy.
        That's where Fast Calories comes in!
      <br />
      <br />
        Fast Calories allows users to enter their zip code and maximum caloric goal. They will then be presented with
        a list of nearby fast food restaurants. Once they decide on a place to eat, Fast Calories 
        will present a combination of items from that restaurant that will allow the user to stay under 
        their desired caloric intake! 
      <br />
      <br />
        Please note: Fast Calories is currenty a work in progress.
